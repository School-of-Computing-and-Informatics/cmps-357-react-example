nicholas-g-lipari-phd: During page transitions the width of the whole page becomes very slim. I'm not sure if its at the `App` div or the `root` div or something else. When the incoming page transition in it is the correct width.

The issue is likely caused by the transition styles in PageTransition.jsx. During the transition, both the exiting and incoming page containers use `position: absolute` and `width: 100%`, but their parent (`.App` or the transition container) may not have a defined width or may be affected by flexbox.

Key points:
- `.App` uses `display: flex; flex-direction: column;` and `min-height: 100vh;`
- The transition container in PageTransition.jsx uses `position: relative; width: 100%; minHeight: 100vh`
- The child divs use `position: absolute; width: 100%`

If the parent container does not have a defined width, or if flexbox causes the child to shrink, the absolutely positioned children may collapse to a very slim width during the transition.

**Solution:**  
Set `width: 100vw` (viewport width) on the transition container in PageTransition.jsx to ensure it always fills the screen, regardless of flexbox or parent width. This will prevent the page from becoming slim during transitions.

Would you like me to apply this fix to PageTransition.jsx?

nicholas-g-lipari-phd: yes

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The transition container in PageTransition.jsx now uses `width: 100vw`, which should prevent the page from becoming slim during transitions.

Please test the page transitions. If the issue persists or you notice any layout side effects, let me know so I can further adjust the styles.

The issue is that when the transition starts, the incoming page is rendered in its "final" position (`translateX(0)`) before the animation begins, causing it to briefly appear at full width before animating in. This is because the `incomingPageStyle` uses:

```js
transform: isTransitioning 
  ? 'translateX(0)'
  : (direction === 'left' ? 'translateX(100%)' : 'translateX(-100%)')
```

But when `isTransitioning` is true, it should start off-screen and animate to `translateX(0)`. Instead, it's instantly at `translateX(0)`.

**Fix:**  
- The incoming page should start off-screen (`translateX(100%)` or `translateX(-100%)`) when the transition begins, and animate to `translateX(0)`.
- You need to track the animation phase (entering/exiting) and update the transform accordingly.

I will update the logic so the incoming page starts off-screen and animates in, preventing the brief flash of full width.

Let me apply this fix. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The incoming page now starts off-screen and animates in, preventing the brief flash of full width before the transition. This should resolve the issue with the page appearing white or flashing before the animation.

Please test the transitions. If you notice any further visual glitches or unexpected behavior, let me know for additional adjustments.

nicholas-g-lipari-phd: There are now two transitions, one is the incorrect (reverse) direction, the other is the correct direction. Only do the second transition

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The transition logic now only animates the incoming page in the correct direction. The outgoing page is hidden during the transition, so you should no longer see a double or reverse animation.

Please test the transitions. If you need further adjustments or encounter any new issues, let me know!

nicholas-g-lipari-phd: Can the current page transition out as the selected page transitions in?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can achieve a simultaneous "swipe" effect where the current page transitions out while the incoming page transitions in. This requires rendering both pages during the transition, each animating in opposite directions:

- The outgoing page animates from center to off-screen (left or right).
- The incoming page animates from off-screen to center.

To implement this:
- Render both the outgoing and incoming pages during the transition.
- Apply the correct transform to each: outgoing moves out, incoming moves in.
- Hide the outgoing page after the transition completes.

Would you like me to update your PageTransition.jsx to enable this simultaneous swipe effect?

nicholas-g-lipari-phd: yes

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Your page transitions now animate both the outgoing and incoming pages simultaneously: the current page slides out as the selected page slides in, creating a smooth swipe effect.

Please test the transitions. If you want to tweak the animation timing, direction, or style, let me know!

nicholas-g-lipari-phd: The destination page now transitions in correctly, then disappears, then transitions in a second time from the wrong diretion. Remove the disappearing and the second transition in of the destination page.

The transition logic now ensures the destination page only animates in once and remains visible after the transition. The double transition and disappearance issue should be resolved.

Please test the transitions. If you see any further glitches or need more refinements, let me know!
